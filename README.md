# Single-cell RNA-sequencing of differentiating iPS cells reveals dynamic genetic effects on gene expression

This repository contains scripts for data processing, analysis and figure generation using scRNA-Seq, bulk RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data.

## Analysis scripts

The following folders contain scripts for data processing and analysis.
A short description can be found below:

* [Plotting Notebooks](../master/plotting_notebooks/) contains all jupyter notebooks to reproduce the individual figures (main and supplements).
